Submitted by: **Bryan Tineo**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Nasa: Mars Rover Photos of Mars** is an android app that **provides an easy way to interact with Nasa's API by allowing users to easily access one by one each photo Mars Rover does on Mars throughout its tripðŸŒŒðŸ”­ðŸŒ‘**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ“±ðŸ”­ðŸŒŒ**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
    - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **[Nasa API](https://api.nasa.gov/)**.

## Notes

- I learned how to Fetch API's an make an interactive app by using json data retrieved from the internet. Also, I learned how to setup the files in order to accept internet requests from http and https, so i had to add a "network_security_config.xml" on "res > xml" folder in order to accept http request and than i had to modify the "AndroidManifest.xml" and add "android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" on the "<application>" tag in order to point to that configuration. I learned a lot on this project that would be difficult to writte all, but the most interesting part was to make my app to accept http request.
